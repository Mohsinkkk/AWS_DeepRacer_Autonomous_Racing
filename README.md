## AWS DeepRacer

AWS DeepRacer is a fully autonomous 1/18th scale race car driven by an **AWS Machine Learning** service for exploring **Reinforcement Learning** focussed on **Autonomous Racing**.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning method that is focused on **autonomous decision-making** by an **agent** in order to achieve specified goals through interactions with an **environment**. In reinforcement learning, learning is achieved through trial and error and **training does not require labeled input**. Training relies on the **reward hypothesis**, which posits that all goals can be achieved by maximizing a future reward after **action** sequences. 

*In reinforcement learning, designing the reward function is important. Better-crafted reward functions result in better decisions by the agent.*

To encourage learning during training, the learning agent must be allowed to sometimes pursue actions that might not result in rewards. This is referred to as the **exploration and exploitation trade-off**. It helps reduce or remove the likelihood that the agent might be misguided into false destinations.

#### Reinforcement Learning in context of Autonomous Racing
For autonomous racing,
- The agent is a vehicle.
- The environment includes traveling routes and traffic conditions.
- The goal is for the vehicle to reach its destination quickly without accidents.
- Rewards are scores used to encourage safe and speedy travel to the destination. The scores penalize dangerous and wasteful driving.
